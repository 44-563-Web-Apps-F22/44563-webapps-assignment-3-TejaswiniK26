        <p>Dianne Duncan Thomas: Quilt Expressions<b>The warm comfort of handmade quilts</b> was an integral part of 
            Dianne Duncan Thomas childhood, so it did not seem unusual that she would take up the craft. She became
             the fifth generation, at least, in her family to find pleasure in the meticulous work. This 
             creative longing was not surprising, given Thomas <b>academic background in graphic 
             design and art history</b> at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln</p>
